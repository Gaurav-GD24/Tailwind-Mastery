# Learning Tailwind CSS

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Tailwind CSS. I'll be updating it daily with my progress as I learn new concepts and techniques. The sandbox contains around different folders/files that focus on specific aspects/classes of Tailwind.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs by composing utility classes directly in your HTML.
